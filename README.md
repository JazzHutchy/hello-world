Heya

My name is Jared. At this time of writing, I am a complete noob at programming and coding. 
I'm taking my first real step into the coding, who knows where it'll take me!

I try to live a balanced life. I like TV series, movies, video games, excercise, long walks on the beach and watching Titanic while sobbing and eating three whole buckets of ice-cream at the same time (don't ask, I make it work).

If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by!
